        <p>Welcome to my page!<br>I am currently a student at Moringa School studying Software Development Prep Course. I am fueled by the passion for being a part of the technology industry. Looking to further venture into data science, branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I consider myself a 'forever student' eager to build on my academic foundations in Data Science and Actuarial Science, and stay in tune with the latest technology through continued coursework and professional development. My hunger for knowledge and determination has contributed to me joining Moringa School. </p>
